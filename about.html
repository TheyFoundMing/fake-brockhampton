            <h1>About Brockhampton</h1>

            <p> Brockhampton (stylized in all caps) is an American rap collective formed
            in San Marcos, Texas, in 2015 and currently based in California. Led by
            Kevin Abstract and formed partially through the online forum "KanyeToThe",
            Brockhampton is a self-described boy band, in an effort to redefine the term.
            Complex magazine describes the group as "gay, black, white, DIY, ambitious,
            all-inclusive, and would-be pop stars," and this diversity is what largely
            distinguishes their lyrics and sound.</p>

            <p>The group released their first mixtape All-American Trash in 2016. Their
            debut studio album, Saturation, was released on June 9, 2017, followed by
            Saturation II on August 25 and Saturation III on December 15. On March 30,
            2018, Brockhampton announced that they had signed a record deal under the
            label RCA Records. Their fourth album, Iridescence, was released on September
            21, 2018 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The album is
            also the first in their second trilogy, known as "The Best Years of Our Lives".</p>

            <p>On July 18, 2019, Brockhampton officially announced their fifth album, Ginger,
            giving it a release date of August. On July 31, they released the first single
            for the album, titled "I Been Born Again", along with a music video. Three more
            singles with accompanying music videos were released throughout August,
            leading up to Ginger's release on August 23, 2019.</p>
